# College project

This is my project from 3rd year web dev subject. I did very simple web app using React, Apollo and GraphQL with Typescript(on backend) and Javascript(as frontend).

# Installation

I used Yarn to make this app so navigate to directory for example:

```shell
cd backend
```

and just type

```shell
yarn
```

same goes for frontend.
